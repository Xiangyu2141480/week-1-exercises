# COMP0210 Research Computing with C++
## Week 1 Exercises

This repository contains a Docker container in the `.devcontainer` folder. You do not need to use the container if you are running Ubuntu natively or using Ubuntu on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). If you are are using Windows without WSL then you must use the Docker container. Mac users may find that they can compile and run most examples natively without the container, but there may be some compatibility issues, so Docker is recommended especially for coursework. 

If you have set up your computer and VSCode environment following the instructions on Moodle you should automatically see an option to reopen in the container; if not you can click the button at the bottom left of the VSCode window and then select the option "Reopen in Container". You will need to have Docker Desktop running before you can open the container.
